COCOMA is a tool for creating deliberate contention (in the future also malicious and faulty) load
in a controlled way.

Quick start
-----------------------------------
Run COCOMA through command line (ccmsh)

First start the scheduler

	ccmsh --start scheduler

	ccmsh -x <path to xml file>


xml files examples can be found in the xml-examples/ and xml-examples/tests/ (the test dir should have more updated xml files)

You can check that jobs have been scheduled by running

	ccmsh --list-jobs all

To understand if the jobs are running properly, you can use "top" or "iostat -x 3" commands
