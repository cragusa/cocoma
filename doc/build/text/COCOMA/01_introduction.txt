One of the main common characteristics of cloud computing is resource
sharing amongst multiple users, through which providers can optimise
utilization and efficiency of their system.

However, at the same time this raises some concerns for performance
predictability, reliability and security:

   * Resource (i.e. CPU, storage and network) sharing inevitably
     creates contention, which affects applications' performance and
     reliability

   * Workloads and applications of different users residing on the
     same physical machine, storage and network are more vulnerable to
     malicious attacks

Studying the effect of resource contention and maliciousness in a
cloud environment can be of interest for different stakeholders.
Experimenters may want to evaluate the performance and security
mechanisms of their system under test (SuT). On the other hand cloud
providers may want to assess their mechanisms to enforce performance
isolation and security.

In order to use COCOMA, an experimenter defines an *emulation* which
embeds all environment operational conditions as shown in the figure
below. The actual operational conditions are defined in what are
called *distributions*, which create specific workloads over the
targeted resource of a specific resource type. For example,
*distribution 1* targets the CPU creating an exponential trend over a
specific time range within the whole emulation. Each distribution time
is divided into multiple time-slots based on the distribution
granularity then broken down into multiple runs each one injecting a
different load level per time slot, which depends on the discrete
function of the distribution.
