Creating Emulation via API Client (Restfully)
*********************************************

This sections provides examples on how to use the REST API via the
restfully client.

First you need to create a configuration file for restfully
"api.cocoma.yml", containing the public IP address of COCOMA:

   uri: http://131.254.204.223/
   require: [ApplicationVndBonfireXml]

The example below creates an emulation with two distributions over the
MEM resource. The file can be saved as a .rb and used by restfully. It
contains the XML payload for COCOMA and a reference to the config file
to connect to the COCOMA VM:

   require 'rubygems'
   require 'restfully'
   require 'logger'

   session = Restfully::Session.new(
    :configuration_file => "~/api.cocoma.yml"

   )

   session.logger.level = Logger::INFO

   emulation = nil

   begin
    emulation = session.root.emulations.submit(
      :emuname => "MEM-emulation",
      :emutype => "Contention",
      :emuresourceType => "RAM",
      :emustartTime => "now",
      :emustopTime => "240",
      :distributions =>[{
            :name => "MEM-increase",
            :startTime =>"0",
            :duration =>"120",
            :granularity =>"10",
            :minJobTime => "2",
            :distribution => {
                :href => "/distributions/linear_incr",
                :name => "linear_incr"
                },
            :startLoad => "10%",
            :stopLoad => "80%",
            :emulator =>{
            :href => "/emulators/stressapptest",
            :name => "stressapptest"},
           :'emulator-params' =>{
                :resourceType =>"MEM",
                :memThreads => "1"
                }
            },
            {
            :name => "MEM-decrease",
            :startTime =>"121",
            :duration =>"119",
            :granularity =>"10",
            :minJobTime => "2",
            :distribution => {
                :href => "/distributions/linear_incr",
                :name => "linear_incr"
                },
            :startLoad => "80%",
            :stopLoad => "10%",
            :emulator =>{
                :href => "/emulators/stressapptest",
                :name => "stressapptest"
                },
            :'emulator-params' =>{
                :resourceType =>"MEM",
                :memThreads => "1"
                }
                   }]
    )

   end

The script can be executed as:

   $ restfully emulation.rb

You can access the COCOMA VM interactively thorugh the "restfully"
client, and check if the emulation was created successfully:

   $ restfully -c cocoma.yml

   >> pp root.emulations
   >> #<Collection:0x45f9f3e uri="/emulations"
   >>  RELATIONSHIPS
   >>    parent, self
   >>  ITEMS (0..2)/2
   >>    #<Resource:0x45b5d3e name="7-CPU_Stress" uri="/emulations/7-CPUStress">
   >>    #<Resource:0x4489eb0 name="8-MEM-emulation" uri="/emulations/8-MEM-emulation">>
   >> => nil
