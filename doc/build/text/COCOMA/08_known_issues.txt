Known Issues
************

The interaction of the various emulators used in COCOMA can cause
unexpected issues. Some of these issues are listed below (This is
*not* an exhaustive list, and will be updated as new issues are
discovered)

* Stressapptest: it uses ~100% CPU, regardless of what resource it
  is being ran on. Also, when using it with high memory consumption,
  it can create issues to processes running in the COCOMA VM, such as
  causing them to crash. The user should be aware of how it is used;

* If a Linear increase distribution is run on memory using
  stressapptest at the same time as Iperf is being used to load the
  Network, then the Network resource may not reach its target load.
  This problem is usually encountered when the memory usage reaches
  over ~80% (as shown in the graph below)

* When running an Emulation containing an Event based distribution,
  then the list of jobs (seen by using the command 'ccmsh -j') may not
  be correct;
