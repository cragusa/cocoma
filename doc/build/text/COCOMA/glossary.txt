*Distribution*
   General function of a specific resourceType over a specific time.
   The time is divided into multiple timeslots (t0,?, tn). A
   distribution is broken down into multiple run(s) depending on the
   shape of the function, where each run introduces a different load
   per time slot

*Emulation*
   Process that imitates a specific behaviour over a resource, with
   one or more distributions, over a specific time range

*Emulator*
   Specific mechanism that is used to create a workload over a
   resource. For example load generators, stress generators, fault
   generators and malicious payload creation.

*Run* or *job*
   Basic emulator instantiation, providing a specific load over a time
