COCOMA
******


Controlled Contentious and Malicious framework
==============================================

The aim of COCOMA framework is to create, monitor and control
contentious and malicious system workload. By using this framework
experimenters are able to create operational conditions under which
tests and experiments can be carried out. This allows more insight
into the testing process so that various scenarios of the cloud
infrastructure behaviour can be analysed by collecting and correlate
metrics of the emulated environment with the test results.

COCOMA is provided by BonFIRE as a service within a VM already
configured that can be added to an experiment and used.
