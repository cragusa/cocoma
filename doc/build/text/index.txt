COCOMA
******


Controlled Contentious and Malicious framework
==============================================

The aim of COCOMA framework is to create, monitor and control
contentious and malicious system workload. By using this framework
experimenters are able to create operational conditions for their
System under Test (SuT) under which tests and experiments can be
carried out. This allows more insight into the testing process of the
SuT so that various scenarios of the cloud infrastructure behaviour
can be analysed by collecting and correlate metrics of the emulated
environment with the test results.

A common approach is to setup COCOMA within a VM and deploy it in a
landscape. As this VM is intended to run mainly COCOMA resources
patterns, other processes in the VM should have almost no impact on
the desired patterns.
